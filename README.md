This is my friend Hussain Zaidi. He is a theoretical physicist and loves puzzles, especially ones that make me look silly.

Let me tell you about the time he got me really good.

## The Monty Hall Problem

As original seen widely on Let's Make a Deal. 

Here is our definition of the game:
> * There are three doors
> * Two doors have a goat behind them and the other door has a *Brand New Car* TM.
> * The player will select a door
> * The host will open a door the player didn't choose revealing a goat.
> * Two doors will remain, one the player chose and the other closed door.
> * The player must choose which door to open. The one they selected **or** they may switch and select the other door.

The question Hussain put to us and now I put to you is ....

# Should You Switch?
I would like everyone to take two minutes in pairs to discuss and decide on the best course of action. On the chance you are familar with this problem please defer to your partner.

## Hussain's Reaction

I was wrong, but refused to believe it. So Hussain gave me the same look this cricket fan gave. But I knew I was right and the way I was going to prove it was with a Monte Carlo simulation. Hussain and his theoretical garbage could not stand up to the awesome power of my simulations ... As it turned out, the simulations proved him correct and I was wrong.
